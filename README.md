## Purpose of the Analysis

The following analysis was conducted to get more information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop and findings presented to a a lead investor. The temperature trends were specifically for the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable all year round. 

## Results

Despite multiple closely similar values, the surfs_up analysis was able to draw a number of conclusions as follows:

* The minimum temperatures in December went as low as 56.00° compared to 64.00° in June. This can be justified by the fact that temperatures do drop in December since its the middle of the winter season and as a result the investor should expect lower income on the ice cream side of business during that particular month as people tend to get ice cream when its a bit warmer.

* A slight difference of 3.903° in the mean between the two months could imply that the business will sustain itself all year round since June is in the middle of the summer and December is in the middle of winter. Having such a small difference between two months in two completely different seasons should be encouraging for any investor to start a surf shop and ice cream shop business. 

* This analysis can be hugely relied on as it used data taken over multiple years and to have such close values in different seasons can be quite convincing for an investor as such trends could be expected to continue. 

The statistics for June are displayed as follows:

## Summary


From the surfs_up analysis, so far it is noticable how the temperature trends can support the business in two different seasons of the year. However, the other seasons, autumn and spring need to be checked to see if the trend can be similar and indeed it is as shown below for the months of April(spring) and September(autumn) respectively:
